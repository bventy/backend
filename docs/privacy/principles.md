# Privacy Principles

Privacy in Bventy is not a feature; it is a foundational architectural choice. We believe that privacy-first design leads to a more dignified marketplace for everyone.

## Core Principles

### Minimal Data Collection
We only bridge the information necessary to facilitate a professional connection. We do not collect "nice-to-have" data for secondary monetization.

### Localized Processing
Data is processed within the context of specific marketplace actions. We avoid systemic profiling of user interests or browsing habits.

### Purpose Limitation
Personal information is used exclusively to enable organizers and vendors to collaborate. It is never sold or shared with outside entities.

### Transparency
We are open about how data flows through the system. This documentation is part of our commitment to ensuring users understand exactly what happens to their information.
