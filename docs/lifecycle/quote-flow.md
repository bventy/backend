# Quote Flow

The quote flow is the central interaction pattern in Bventy. It is designed to be deliberate and structured to prevent premature communication and ensure clarity.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Request Stage
The organizer initiates a request with specific parameters (date, location, guest count, description). At this stage, the vendor sees the request but has not yet committed.

### 2. Proposal Stage
The vendor reviews the request and submits a proposal. This includes a price and any specific terms or questions. The vendor's contact information remains hidden.

### 3. Review Stage
The organizer reviews the vendor's response. They can request revisions if the proposal does not fully align with their needs.

### 4. Acceptance Stage
The organizer accepts the proposal. This is a commitment to move forward with the vendor under the stated terms.

### 5. Fulfillment Stage
Upon acceptance, contact details are revealed. Both parties can now communicate directly to finalize details and execute the service.

## Design Intent

By enforcing these stages, we ensure that:
- Conversations are focused on the task at hand.
- Vendors only spend time communicating with organizers who are serious about their proposal.
- Organizers are not overwhelmed by unsolicited follow-ups.
