# How Bventy Works for Organizers

Bventy provides a structured environment for event organizers to find and collaborate with vendors. Our goal is to ensure you have clear, comparable proposals before you share your contact information.

## The Organizer's Journey

### 1. Vendor Selection
Browse the marketplace to find vendors whose portfolio and style align with your event vision.

### 2. Requesting a Quote
Initiate a request by providing your event's details. This includes the date, location, guest count, and a clear description of your requirements.

### 3. Reviewing Proposals
Vendors will respond with a price and their specific vision for your event. You can compare these responses in one central dashboard.

### 4. Refining Requirements
If a proposal needs adjustment, you can request a revision. This allows you to finalize terms without the pressure of a direct phone call or email chain.

### 5. Acceptance and Connection
Once you are satisfied with a proposal, you accept it. This unlocks the vendor's secure contact information, allowing you to move to the execution phase.

## Why This Structure Matters

By gating contact information until acceptance, we protect your privacy and ensure that your inbox is only filled with communications you have explicitly approved.
