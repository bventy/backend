# How Bventy Works for Vendors

Bventy is designed to protect your time and ensure you have the context you need to provide accurate, professional quotes.

## The Vendor's Experience

### 1. Receiving Requests
When an organizer identifies you as a potential fit, you'll receive a structured request with all the necessary event parameters. You don't have to guess the budget or guest count.

### 2. Crafting Proposals
Submit a proposal that includes your pricing and any specific notes about your service. Your contact details are not shared at this stage, preventing unsolicited inquiries.

### 3. Managing Revisions
If an organizer asks for changes, you can update your proposal directly through the platform. This keeps the agreement clear and documented.

### 4. Booking the Event
Once an organizer accepts your quote, their contact information is revealed to you. You can then proceed with your standard contract and fulfillment process.

### 5. Professional Stewardship
By utilizing our structured workflow, you maintain a high standard of professional communication, ensuring that every booking starts with a clear mutual understanding.

## Our Commitment to You

Bventy is built to uphold vendor dignity. We ensure that you are only communicating with serious organizers who value your professional service and transparent pricing.
